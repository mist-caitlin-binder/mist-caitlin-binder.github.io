				<p> Let’s use the fundamentals of organic chemistry to explain how cannabis tinctures are made!
				THCA and THC are organic compounds, meaning they contain a lot of carbon atoms. THCA is uniquely synthesized in cannabis flowers via biochemical pathways. The surface of cannabis flower petals are covered in delicate trichomes. These look like hairs to the naked eye, but are actually microscopic spikes with rounded tops in which the THCA is stored. Releasing more THCA from the flower leads to more effective activation (conversion of THCA to THC) and extraction processes, resulting in a more potent tincture.

				<div class="stepDescription">
					<p>Cannabis flowers are relatively large, green buds. A lot of the THCA-trichomes are on the inside of the bud and need to be released. Breaking up the flower with a grinder increases the surface area exposure of the trichome-covered-buds, releasing the THCA for subsequent activation!</p>

	<summary class="stepTitle">Decarboxylation</summary>
		<div class="stepContent">

			<div class="stepDescription">
				<p>The THCA produced by cannabis is non-psychoactive (inactive). Mild heat is required to convert THCA into THC in a process called decarboxylation (de-carb-ox-yl-a-tion).</p>
				<p>De-<strong>carboxyl</strong>-ation means THC loses <strong>one carbon atom</strong> and <strong>two oxygen atoms</strong> in the form of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), which evaporates during the mild heating process. The resulting “decarb’d flower” now contains active THC.

		<div class="stepContent">

			<div class="stepDescription">
				<p>THC dissolves in high-proof alcohol and vegetable oils. This is because these polar, organic molecules tend to stick together. You may recall the heuristic from basic chemistry: “Like dissolves like.” The decarb’d flower is mostly plant material like cellulose, which does not dissolve in alcohol or veggie oil. THC dissolves into the solvent (alcohol or oil), thus separating itself from the solid plant material.</p>
