   What is Cannabis Tincture?
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
	<p> Cannabis tincture is made from activated (decarboxylated) marijuana flowers that have been extracted into a liquid solvent and filtered. </p> 
	<p> Vegetable oil and high-proof alcohol are the most common solvents for tinctures.  </p>
	<p> The tincture is a solution (mixture) of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, in oil or alcohol.  </p>
	<p> Store-bought cannabis tinctures tend to be very expensive when purchased from a marijuana dispensary, considering the relative simplicity of the recipe and availability of materials. </p>   
	<p> The chemistry behind this procedure will be described in future pages!</p>

   Step 1: Prepare the Flower
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Obtain 7 grams of flower from your local dispensary. 
			<p> Note: The scale is not necessary, as 7 grams is equal to a “quarter ounce” of marijuana buds that can be purchased from a local dispensary. </p>
			<p> In small batches, use an electric coffee/spice grinder or a hand-held grinder to break the flower down into smaller pieces.Careful not to overgrind to a powder, as this will make later steps more difficult. </p> 
			<p> Transfer the ground flower to a pie plate in an even layer and cover tightly with aluminum foil. </p>

   Step 2: Heat to Activate the THC via Decarboxylation
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Why? The THCA in the flower needs to be converted into THC to unleash marijuana’s psychoactive properties (we’ll save the chemistry explanation for another time). This process, called “decarboxylation” requires mild heat. </p>
			<p> Caution: higher temperatures will burn the flower; double-check your oven temperature! </p> 
			<p> Place the covered pie plate with flower into the pre-heated oven for 30 minutes. A skunky aroma indicates that decarboxylation is taking place. </p> 
			<p>Remove the pie plate from the oven and let cool to room temperature before removing the foil.  </p>
			<p>The initially <b> green flower should now be light brown</b>, as shown in the image. You now have decarboxylated (decarb’d) flower, where the inactive THCA has been converted to active THC. </p>

   Step 3: Extraction of THC into Solvent
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Transfer the decarb’d flower to a glass mason jar. </p>
			<p> Add 2 cups of your liquid solvent-of-choice: high proof alcohol (Everclear) or liquid vegetable oil (avocado or canola oil is recommended).  </p> 
			<p> Gently swirl to mix and cap with tight-fitting seal and lid. </p> 
			<p>Leave this mixture in a cool dark place for 1 week, mixing gently each day. </p>
			<p>The liquid solvent should change in color to a green/brown. </p>

   Step 4: Filter the Tincture 
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Allow the solid plant material to settle at the bottom of the jar - DO NOT MIX before filtering. </p>
			<p> Place a pour-over coffee funnel with paper filter (or a small mesh strainer with cheesecloth) on top of a wide-mouth, glass measuring cup with handle.  </p> 
			<p> Decant as much liquid as possible from the jar into the funnel, leaving the solids in the jar for now, and allow it to drain. </p> 
			<p>Add the remaining contents of the jar, being careful not to spill or overflow the funnel. </p>
			<p>Note the stark contrast in the color of your filtered tincture, as the alcohol was initially clear! </p>

<div class="stepTitle">
	
   Step 5: Transfer into Labeled Containers for Storage 
		</div>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Label the dropper bottles, securing the label with clear mailing tape to prevent the solvent from ruining the label. </p>
			<p> Pour the liquid directly from the measuring cup in the previous step into the bottles. You may want to use a small funnel for this step, if available.  </p> 
			<p> The resulting liquid filtrate is a solution of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the solvent of choice. This tincture can be added directly to flavored food and beverages for consumption. 
			<p>It is strongly advised to exercise caution with initial doses, starting with a few drops and gradually increasing to achieve desired effects.</p>
